      faq: |
        ## I am a newbie, and I have a presentation to introduce

        In RubyJax we are not there to make fun of the novices. We will be
        ALWAYS delighted to welcome talks beginners as confirmed.


        ## I would like to make a presentation of more than 20 minutes

        The presentations are timed, with the aim not to
        Tire rubyists who listen to you. Studies have proven
        That the 2 best timings are: 5 minutes and 20 minutes.

        ## Introduce company and or product


        We are here to talk about Ruby, Rails, and the world of
        Startups in Jacksonville. To promote a company, a
        Product, or look for a profile, the custom is to help the
        Community by sponsoring Ruby events.

        If you have any further questions, please send an email to
        [Michael](mailto:michaelgdimmitt@gmail.com)
